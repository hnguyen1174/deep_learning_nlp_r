## EHR Symptom Detection

### Introduction

There are many challenges that are associated with natural language processing in healthcare. Previous studies have shown that the inability to effectively model the subtleties of the medical sublanguage hinder performance. To deal with this problem, practitioners in other fields have attempted to standardize the language before feeding them into machine learning models. However, because of the invariability of the clinical vocabularies and a lack of standardization in medical annotation practices, this is not practical in healthcare. In addition, traditional NLP methods can work with synonyms but not similar terms, so many of them suffer from the curse of dimensionality.

In the face of such challenges, advanced methods in natural language processing such as CNN, LSTM and BERT are also gaining popularity. This project investigates whether using deep learning models will result in better predictive performance compared to traditional machine learning methods.
